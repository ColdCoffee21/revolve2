# METADATA:

# backforth means that in cond 1 speed_y should be max and in cond 2 speed_y should be min
# back and forth are visually left and right respectively (in practice, first it goes forth and then back)

# forthright means that in cond 1 speed_y should be max and in cond 2 speed_x should be max
# forth and right are visually right and down respectively
